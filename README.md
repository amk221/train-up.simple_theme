# A simple WordPress theme for use with Train-Up! e-learning plugin

## Installation

1. Simply drop this into your WordPress __themes__ folder
2. Activate the theme from within WordPress

### Why?

The [Train-Up!](wptrainup.co.uk) e-learning plugin for WordPress adds a training section to any WordPress website. 

The plugin itself comes with a built-in sub-theme, that is only active when you visit `/training` on your website.

If you only require the training section for your site, you can rely on the plugin completely and not have to develop an actual theme!

This _Simple Theme_ just acts as the bare-bones to get your WordPress e-learning site up and running.
